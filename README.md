# Deception_Detector
The Deception Detector project uses machine learning and NLP to identify deceptive content like fake news. By training a model on labeled datasets, it distinguishes between truthful and deceptive information. The project can be deployed as a web app, helping to combat misinformation and improve content reliability online.
